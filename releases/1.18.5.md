- ## Interface

  - Add manual verification to the Patreon process.
  - Reduce lag when loading large files.
  - Reduce save file size.
  - [Graph] Improve display performance.
  - [Graph] Adjust junction distance and padding to match default grid settings (this makes junction 25% smaller).
  - [Graph] Improve junction rendering on non-integer zoom level.
  - [Graph] Change extension order for diagonal connection to be based on distance to edge instead of ascending.
  - [Graph] Add undo point for junction anchor positioning.
  - [Timeline] Hold ctrl while dragging the frame cursor to move outside the animation range.

  

  ## Node
  
  - New Sample gradient node
  - New Oklch color node
  - Loading graph now ignores connectivity rules.
  - New pure function group: A group that only contains static nodes will now be flagged as "pure" and render faster (can be opt-out on the settings page).

  
  
  - Path input now supports "./" for relative location. 
  - Node that connects between inline groups will automatically be included in the group on load.
  - Setting any file path will now try to redirect the missing file to the new directory.
  - [SmokeSim] Improve simulation accuracy.
  - [SmokeSim domain] Add boundary conditions (wall, wrap).
  - [SmokeSim domain] Add timestep property.
  - [SmokeSim render] Now use domain dimension by default.
  - [SmokeSim emitter] Add built-in shape types.
  - [SmokeSim emitter] Add repulsive, vortex fields.
  - [Crop content] Background now defaults to transparent instead of black.
  - [Group IO] Now show the node name when zoomed out.
  - [Armature create] Improve interface
  - [Armature create] Combine move and scale to a proper transform tool.
  - [Armature create] New bone mirror tool.
  - [Armature pose] Posing now modify vec4 node if connected.
  - [Armature pose] IK now takes priority when selecting.
  - [Armature create, pose, rig] Now render armature in graph.
  - [Inline Loop] Now display repeat junction if set visible.
  - [Array Sample] Input changed to `any` type.
  - [VFX Trail] Add a label to enable "output all particles" at the spawner node to render properly.
  - [VFX] Double-clicking on another non-render node now shows the render preview.
  - [Number] Rotator display type will also affect preview gizmo.
  - [Number] New flat-style display option.
  - [Number] New increment display.
  - [Number] Range, step, and speed properties now available for rotator type.
  - [Palette extract] Add mask input.
