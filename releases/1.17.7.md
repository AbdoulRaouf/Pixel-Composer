## Bugs
- [Graph Panel] Fix the error when dropping a project file to the panel.
- [Graph Panel] Fix connection corner misbehaving in elbow mode.
- [Graph Panel] Fix preview scale error when zooming out very far.
- [Graph Panel] Fix junction not updating its initial position when a node is created while playing.
- [Graph Panel] Fix curve data not connectable.
- [Graph Panel] Fix error when hotkey node creation got canceled.
- [Graph Panel] Fix the inverted vertical align button.
